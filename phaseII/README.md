# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

During Phase II of the Sound Circle Application, our time was focused on evaluating our current designs using a cognative walkthrough and informal feedback approaches. Using these research strategies, we would benefit from a fresh perspective towards our application to better help our design development. We were to then use our newly collected ideas in order to fine-tune and modify our wireframe design to better help ourselves and assist our partner software engineers in their software design process.

## Methods

In Phase II of developing the SoundCircle Application, our UX team employed several research strategies to evaluate our current design progress. The first method researched we used was a Cognitive Walkthrough. We invited students from other Usability Engineering UX teams to review and analyze the current wireframe iteration of SoundCircle.

Three external UX student evaluators(n = 3) were given access to SoundCircle's Wireframes and asked to throughly scrutinize our designs by stepping into the shoes of one of our personas, named Samantha, within her designated scenario. Samantha is a 24-year-old recent graduate who travels to various music venues to explore her musical interests. Though she is shy, she aspires to make friends through the SoundCircle application. Given her scenario, she hopes to connect with local friends who can accompany her to a concert.

Using Samantha’s persona and scenario, the UX evaluators steped through and identified several overlooked and vulnerable areas within the application Wireframe. At this stage, the Wireframes lacked several key features important to Samantha, such as lack of friend-making and profile creation, functional location data, event details and population and searching categories. Additionally, the evaluators emphasized the need to clearly differentiate SoundCircle as both a music-based social media platform and an event interaction application.Their analyses highlighted several shortcomings in the SoundCircle design that the team set out to address and improved upon throughout the iterations in Phase II.

Another research method we employed was gathering informal feedback from the CSCI 430 Software Engineering class (n = 65). We posed two key questions to the students. The first question was, "As a potential user, what features or functionalities would make you more likely to use this software and connect with new people?" The second question asked, "In what situations could you see yourself using this application?" From their feedback, it was found that most of the ideas suggested were ones that we had in mind for later implementation but it better steered us in the right directions in proritization.

The report's methods section should give detailed instructions on how the cognitive walkthrough was performed, including:
* What questions were answered with each step of the cognitive walkthrough


## Findings

Among 3 feedbacks our team received from the cognitive walkthrough, 2 of which were corresponding to persona Samantha, the other one corresponded to persona Steve.

For Steve, user found out that our product's main page is overwhelming to some degree as it was described as "a lot of information is presented at once". The user also pointed out that the user profile need more clear options to allow be editing because the product was missing buttons to indicate editability. The user wondered that why not asking questions related to music tastes, genres, artists,...after the user finished creating an account. In addition, as the user wants to check out other users' profile, they also want to be able to message the currently viewed user.

For Samantha, users successfully created posts but wonder where to look for, this can be interpreted as the users want to see what post they have made and notifications regarding to their posts (whether someone else like/comment on the post).

As of the feedbacks during the first presentations, the class of software engineers made some suggestions to our team's product. We to be selective among received comments to assest what changes would fit best for out product. We consider making changes for the following problems: The user page was lacking options to add/follow friends that share similar palate in music; some users want to be able to see who also attend the events with them; not giving users ability to share links of posts, events, and music.

## Conclusions

The SoundCircle developers acknowledge that our product need a lot of changes to the UI in order to boost the satisfaction of user experience.

In regard to feedbacks we receive, changes have been made to the product.

The first change was for the login process. After successfully login with google account, the app will navigate user to a different page to set up the user's profile. Only after going through the prompts that the user will see the main home page. This is to eliminate the "overwhelming first impression" for new users.

In addition, our team have completely changed the set up for the user profile page. Realizing that our first design of user page is considerably amateur, we decided to uptake our user profile page by enabling adding friends, following people, editing profiles (add preferences, taste, genres,...), showing events. In addition, as an attempt to differentiate our product to other social media platform such as Facebook and Instagram, the SoundCircle UX designers decided to add album review feature on the user page. The user will be able to show their opinions, including scores and commments, on albums that they find like/dislike.

We hope these combined changes will further satisfy user's experience as well as making our product stand out to our competitors.


## Caveats

Despite receiving usable feedback via the usage of Cognitive Walkthroughs performed by external UX designers, the UX team deduced several caveats that affected the overall ability to optimally judge the direction of our current sprint. By not conducting the Cognitive Walkthrough using UX design professionals the UX team is basing our findings on that of external amateur designers who, although using good and reliable practices, have not only inexperience within the field but may also be prone to personality biases (being too nice or too harsh) when performing the designated walkthroughs. Along with utilizing these inexperienced designers, only a small sample size of two out of three Cognitive Walkthroughs were applicable to the current design sprint. Finally, the UX team is still relying on the inferred information used from previously created Personas and Scenarios that are not based upon market research.

Informal Feedback methods were also impacted primarily via the target audience being comprised of mainly computer science students and not a more diverse group. Having a more diverse audience to gather feedback from would provide a more realistic and viable interpretation of our target audience. This may have resulted in most feedback being received as feature requests which were already being represented within the UX team’s user stories board.
