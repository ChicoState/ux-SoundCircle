# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

Among 3 feedbacks our team received from the cognitive walkthrough, 2 of which were corresponding to persona Samantha, the other one corresponded to persona Steve.

For Steve, user found out that our product's main page is overwhelming to some degree as it was described as "a lot of information is presented at once". The user also pointed out that the user profile need more clear options to allow be editing because the product was missing buttons to indicate editability. The user wondered that why not asking questions related to music tastes, genres, artists,...after the user finished creating an account. In addition, as the user wants to check out other users' profile, they also want to be able to message the currently viewed user.

For Samantha, users successfully created posts but wonder where to look for, this can be interpreted as the users want to see what post they have made and notifications regarding to their posts (whether someone else like/comment on the post).

As of the feedbacks during the first presentations, the class of software engineers made some suggestions to our team's product. Our team has to be selective among received comments to assest what changes would fit best for out product.
* Friend suggestions to users who share same type of music.
* Show who also comes to the events that the user will be attending. 
* Being able to control what other will see on the user page.
* Sharing link of music, link of posts.
## Conclusions


## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
