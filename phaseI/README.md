# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

When designing sound Sound Circle, we decided to create it as a new music sharing, searching, and chatting application which helps the user find others with similar interest and make new friends with similar music tastes. Its application can also be used to share users favorite songs and playlists as well as find musical venues and concerts nearby. Sounds circle is made for music enjoyers, by music lovers.

## Methods
When conducting research for SoundCircle, our UX team used and conducted multiple separate research methods in order to gain a better understanding of both our competitors’ strengths and weaknesses and what our end user may desire. Our first method of research consisted of a competitive analysis of multiple companies’ products that were similar to our own, though they have their own distinct features. The team selected 7 applications or websites and grouped them by similar main features such as “Music Listening Platform”, “Social Media Platform”, and “Messaging Platform”. From there the UX team determined and categorized the groupings strengths, weaknesses, quality, price, and platform. The team then took this data and determined several main demographics of users who would likely use most of these applications or websites.

Following the competitive analysis the UX team conducted a heuristic evaluation of our main competitor. This was chosen based on the team’s educated assumptions for the current main product of SoundCircle. To this end, “Facebook” was chosen to be evaluated based on the social media aspects of SoundCircle. The UX team utilized “NNgroup”s article on “Ten Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design” to evaluate and score “Facebook”s heuristics on a 1-10 scale. These heuristics were separated into the categories: Visibility of System Status, Match Between the System and the Real World, User Control and Freedom, Consistency and Standards, Error Prevention, Recognition Rather than Recall, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, Aesthetic and Minimalist Design, Help Users Recognize Diagnose and Recover from Errors, and Help and Documentation. Accompanying the determined 1-10 score were the team’s personally educated determinations of the strengths and weaknesses of the given heuristic category.

## Findings

Through Heuristic Evaluation, we learn that one of our competitors, Facebook, did an excellent job in almost every category. The platform excels in areas such as Matching between system and real world; Consistency and standard; Visibility of system status; and Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, ensuring a smooth experience for its users. However, there are a few usability minor concerns, particularly related to Flexibility and efficiency of use, and also Help and documentation. While Facebook, our competitor, provides a comprehensive platform some features can be challenging to use. For instance, managing privacy settings can feel overwhelming due to the multilayers and unclear terminology. We believe this issue should significantly increase user satisfaction should we find a way to tackle it.

Through competitive analysis, we anticipate that the majority of our potential audience would prefer a well-designed, user-friendly interface as it can enhance their overall experience. A seamless and intuitive interface will not only meet their needs but also increase engagement and satisfaction, providing our users with the best experience for a music-based social media app. In addition, our UX team also learned that the demographic of our designated users is very specific: college students, teenagers, festival or concert attendees. These users are particularly focused on forming new friendships and connections, which again highlights the importance of a well-designed UI that cater to their social and interactional needs.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
