# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

As we started to design Sound Circle, we decided to focus it as a music listening and searching platform that also incorperated music sharing and social chatting operations that also helps the user find friends with people of similar musical interests and tastes. During this first phase, we conducted in-depth research on our competitors strengths and weaknesses, how well their systems perform and preset, and how we should design and convey our system, all through various research techniques.

## Methods
When conducting research for SoundCircle, our UX team used and conducted multiple separate research methods in order to gain a better understanding of both our competitors’ strengths and weaknesses and what our end user may desire. Our first method of research consisted of a competitive analysis of multiple companies’ products that were similar to our own, though they have their own distinct features. The team selected 7 applications or websites and grouped them by similar main features, such as “Music Listening Platform”, “Social Media Platform”, and “Messaging Platform”. From there, the UX team determined and categorized the groupings strengths, weaknesses, quality, price, and platform. The team then took this data and determined several main demographics of users who would likely use most of these applications or websites.

Following the competitive analysis, the UX team conducted a heuristic evaluation of our main competitor. This was chosen based on the team’s educated assumptions for the current main product of SoundCircle. To this end, “Facebook” was chosen to be evaluated based on the social media aspects of SoundCircle. The UX team utilized “NNgroup”s article on “Ten Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design” to evaluate and score Facebook's heuristics on a 1-10 scale. These heuristics were separated into the 10 categories listed in the aforementioned article by "NNgroup". Accompanying the determined 1-10 score were the team’s personally educated determinations of the strengths and weaknesses of the given heuristic category.

## Findings

Through competitive analysis, we anticipate that the majority of our potential audience would prefer a well-designed UI and the friend suggestion feature as it can enhance their overall experience. A seamless and intuitive interface will not only meet their needs but also increase engagement and satisfaction, providing our users with the best experience for a music-based social media app. Moreover, the ability to find people around you for friend suggestions is highly effective, allowing users to easily connect with others in their vicinity through similar taste in music, hobbies, or any musical events around their location. This makes it convenient for users to expand their network and nuture new connections effortlessly.
In addition, our UX team also learned that the demographic of our designated users is very specific: college students, teenagers, festival or concert attendees. These users are particularly focused on forming new friendships and connections, which again highlights the importance of a well-designed UI that cater to their social and interactional needs.

Through Heuristic Evaluation we learned that one of our competitors, Facebook, did an excellent job in almost every category. The platform excels in areas such as Matching between system and real world; Consistency and standard; Visibility of system status; and Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, ensuring a smooth experience for its users. However, there are a few minor usability concerns, particularly related to Flexibility and Efficiency of use, and also Help and documentation. While Facebook provides a comprehensive platform some features can be challenging to use. For instance, managing privacy settings can feel overwhelming due to the multilayers and unclear terminology. We believe this issue should significantly increase user satisfaction should we find a way to tackle it.

## Conclusions

By using self-made demographic personas, the UX team determined that the main focus of current application features should steer towards a more localized social media presence. This determination led to the immediate development of a community focused "feed" consisting of user created "posts". Using the data collected via the conducted heuristic analysis, the UX team recommends that future development steers towards a more community focused experience for the end user in regards to their music related interests; meaning that some features such as groups, friends, location based feed, may be required in future development. Based on our use of persona's and collaborative UX/SE team user stories, the UX team created the current MVP sketch which focuses on a user feed and a skeletonized framework for future development of a likely API driven sidebar.

## Caveats

Considering the caveats of Sound Circle, despite the various evaluations and research pathways explored, the absence of user-based testing and data analysis impairs our ability to fully judge our user profiles. From the multiple user analysis simulations used during this sprint, they weren't exactly influenced by actual users and could instead be generating misleading assumptions of user wants and needs, which in turn could diverge from actual expectations of our application. Personas and scenarios gave us some general user-based designs to work off of, but they were created as inspirations and lack the depth of real user feedback. Similarly, the comparative analysis and huristic evaluations offer us valuable analysis on the industry insights but fail to account for specific user needs and preferences of our target demographic. This gap leaves a significant loss in understanding a user's true desires and expectations in the end, which will be something to consider and improve upon down the line.
