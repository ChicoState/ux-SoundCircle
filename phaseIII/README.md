# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Phase III of the UX research for SoundCircle focused on developing and user-testing the main UI prototype developed by the UX team. A structured set of questions and tasks was designed to evaluate the accessibility and functionality of the application, providing actionable insights in order to assist application development and refine the primary interface design.

## Methods

During Phase III the UX team developed a UI prototype for the SoundCircle application and designed an accompanying draft protocol to test user experiences. The study aimed to assess key components of usability such as navigation, accessibility, functionality, and user satisfaction by using a formative evaluation approach. Participants were guided through a think-aloud process, encouraging them to verbalize their thoughts while interacting with the prototype in order to provide real-time insights into their experience.

### Protocol Overview
The study was divided into four main stages: **Introduction**, **Baseline Questions**, **Task-Based Testing**, and a **Debrief** session.

### Introduction
Participants were introduced to the study following the signature of an informed consent form.  They were reassured that the study was focused on evaluating the prototype, not their individual performance. This stage was aimed to set a comfortable tone and ensure the participants felt at ease with sharing their feedback.

### Baseline Questions
This section gathered contextual information about participants’ habits and preferences related to music and social media. These insights were used to understand user needs and expectations to allow for improvements on future iterations of SoundCircle’s design.

*“How often do you listen to music?”*
* This question was designed in order to establish participants’ level of engagement with music to contextualize their responses during testing and help the team understand the prototypes’ relevance to their daily lives.

*“Do you interact with friends, family, or others about music online? If so, which platforms do you use?”*
* By exploring participants’ current online behaviors, this question identified existing platforms that rely on and can help frame SoundCircle’s competitive positioning. 

*“On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it for you to meet people with similar music tastes?”*
* The goal of this question was to assess the importance of social networking features within the context of music, highlighting the value participants place on connections through shared interests.

*“Which social media platforms do you use most frequently?”*
* Understanding participants’ digital habits provided insights into the online ecosystem that SoundCircle needs to integrate with or differentiate itself from.

*“Are there any features or aspects of these platforms that you find frustrating or difficult to use?”*
* Identifying problem points in other platforms will allow the team to focus on addressing these gaps in SoundCircle’s design.

*“Would you find it useful to connect with others based on mutual interests in music? Why or why not?”*
* This question explored participants’ attitudes towards a core purpose of SoundCircle and provide valuable feedback on its perceived utility.

*“How often do you attend music-related events?”*
* This question assessed how likely participants are to engage with event-related content and features of the application.

*“What challenges have you faced when searching for music related events in your local area?”*
* Participants’ responses highlighted existing frustrations in event discovery, providing insight for the team to refine features and address these issues within SoundCircle.

*“If a platform helped you discover events and connect with others based on shared music interests, what would make it stand out for you?”*
* This open-ended question encouraged participants to share specific ideas for making SoundCircle a unique and valuable utility.

### Task-Based Testing
Participants completed six structured tasks to evaluate various aspects of the prototype. Each task simulated a realistic scenario and was designed to test specific features and their usability.

**Task 1: Finding and following an artist**
* This task assessed how easily participants could use the search and navigation features to locate and follow an artist and provided insight into the system’s learnability and efficiency.

**Task 2: Locating an event**
* The purpose of this task was to evaluate the prototype’s event discovery system, focusing on how well participants could find relevant information.

**Task 3: Responding to a direct message
* This task tested the communication features, assessing how intuitive and straightforward it was for participants to interact with direct messages.

**Task 4: Joining a local group**
* By having participants find and join a group, this task evaluated the accessibility of community-building features within the application.

**Task 5: Commenting on a post**
* This task focused on how participants engaged with public content, providing feedback on interaction design and user satisfaction.

**Task 6: Creating and sharing a review for an album**
* This task examined the content creation process, assessing how smoothly participants could share their opinions with others.

After completing each task, participants were asked to rate its difficulty on a scale from 1 to 5 and explain their rating. This approach combined both quantitative and qualitative feedback, allowing the team to pinpoint problem areas for improvement.

### Debrief
The study concluded with a debrief session to gather participants’ overall impressions of the prototype. Open-ended questions encouraged participants to reflect on their experiences and provide actionable feedback for the UX team.

*“How would you describe your overall experience using this prototype?”*
* This question aimed to evaluate general usability and participant satisfaction, offering high-level insights into the platform’s effectiveness.

*“What were your initial thoughts about the website’s design and layout?”*
* Participants’ responses to this question provided feedback on the visual design and aesthetic impact on first impressions.

*“Was the purpose of this website clear to you? Why or why not?”*
* By assessing clarity, this question helped identify areas where the purpose or functionality of the application could be communicated more effectively.

*“Were there any tasks that you found particularly difficult or confusing to accomplish? Why?”*
* This question allowed participants to highlight specific usability issues and guiding future targeted design improvements.

*“What did you like most about the website?”*
* Positive feedback from this question helped identify strengths to build upon in future iterations.

*“What would you change or improve to make it better?”*
* Constructive feedback from participants provided direct suggestions for enhancing the user experience.

*“How likely are you to use a platform like this in the future? Why?”*
* This question assessed participants’ overall interest and likelihood of adopting SoundCircle in order to reveal its potential long-term appeal.

### Overall Approach
The study focused on following a formative evaluation approach, primarily identifying and addressing usability issues in the prototype’s early development stage. Using the think-aloud protocol, participants verbalized their thoughts while interacting with the prototype. This method allowed the team to capture immediate insights into participants' cognitive process, helping uncover challenges and opportunities for future refinement.

## Findings

The usability test was condeucted with 6 participants to evaluate the ease of use and user experience of our SoundCircle prototype. The data collection includes both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics.
**Quantitative Data**:
* Task Completion Rate: 93% of participants successfully completed the primary task (navigating home/user page, follow user, add groups, look up people/artists) without assistance.
* Error rate: An average of 30% of participants agree that the "near-by" option on homepage was too small to see. In addition, more than 50% of participants had trouble looking for way to make an album review which located in user's "Review" page.
**Qualitative Data**
* Even though there are difficulties in completing some of the tasks, most participants' feedback on the prototype are extremely positive. They appreciated the intuitive design of the homepage and the feature to connect with others based on music taste.
* In addition, although most of the feedback were positive and the participants successfully completed most of the given tasks. There are some drawbacks that the team had to acknowledge in order to make improvements: There was too much information on the screen, the sidebar looked like advertisement, and the product looked too close to Facebook.

From the user testing of the Sound Circle Prototype, we found that most users interacted well and completed our prototype with varried ways of success. In terms of the usability, some users found it to be intuative, fresh and well designed and enjoyable while some thought it was redundant in sections, the was prototype overly buggy, and even disregareded important sections due to it being overcluttered. Only so much could be done in the prototypes implementation and much of the variability and openess of our design was un-implemented due to time constraints and the softwarse usability issues.
