# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

The usability test was condeucted with 6 participants to evaluate the ease of use and user experience of our SoundCircle prototype. The data collection includes both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics.
** Quantitative Data**:
* Task Completion Rate: 93% of participants successfully completed the primary task (navigating home/user page, follow user, add groups, look up people/artists) without assistance.
* Error rate: An average of 30% of participants agree that the "neayby" option on homepage was too small to see. In addition, more than 50% of participants had trouble looking for way to make an album review which located in user's "Review" page.
**Qualitative Data**
* Even though there are difficulties in completing some of the tasks, most participants' feedback on the prototype are extremely positive. They appreciated the intuitive design of the homepage and the feature to connect with others based on music taste.
* In addition, although most of the feedback were positive and the participants successfully completed most of the given tasks. There are some drawbacks that the team had to acknowledge in order to make improvements: There are too much information on the screen, sidebar looked like advertisement, look too close to Facebook.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
