# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Phase III of the UX research for SoundCircle focused on developing and user-testing the main UI prototype developed by the UX team. A structured set of questions and tasks was designed to evaluate the accessibility and functionality of the application, providing actionable insights in order to assist application development and refine the primary interface design.

## Methods

During Phase III the UX team developed a UI prototype for the SoundCircle application and designed an accompanying draft protocol to test user experiences. The study aimed to assess key components of usability such as navigation, accessibility, functionality, and user satisfaction by using a formative evaluation approach. Participants were guided through a think-aloud process, encouraging them to verbalize their thoughts while interacting with the prototype in order to provide real-time insights into their experience.

### Protocol Overview
The study was divided into four main stages: **Introduction**, **Baseline Questions**, **Task-Based Testing**, and a **Debrief** session.

### Introduction
Participants were introduced to the study following the signature of an informed consent form. They were reassured that the study was focused on evaluating the prototype, not their individual performance. This stage was aimed at setting a comfortable tone and ensuring the participants felt at ease with sharing their feedback.

### Baseline Questions
This section gathered contextual information about participants’ habits and preferences related to music and social media. These insights were used to understand user needs and expectations to allow for improvements on future iterations of SoundCircle’s design.

*“How often do you listen to music?”*
* This question was designed in order to establish participants’ level of engagement with music to contextualize their responses during testing and help the team understand the prototypes’ relevance to their daily lives.

*“Do you interact with friends, family, or others about music online? If so, which platforms do you use?”*
* By exploring participants’ current online behaviors, this question identified existing platforms that rely on and can help frame SoundCircle’s competitive positioning. 

*“On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it for you to meet people with similar music tastes?”*
* The goal of this question was to assess the importance of social networking features within the context of music, highlighting the value participants place on connections through shared interests.

*“Which social media platforms do you use most frequently?”*
* Understanding participants’ digital habits provided insights into the online ecosystem that SoundCircle needs to integrate with or differentiate itself from.

*“Are there any features or aspects of these platforms that you find frustrating or difficult to use?”*
* Identifying problem points in other platforms will allow the team to focus on addressing these gaps in SoundCircle’s design.

*“Would you find it useful to connect with others based on mutual interests in music? Why or why not?”*
* This question explored participants’ attitudes towards a core purpose of SoundCircle and provided valuable feedback on its perceived utility.

*“How often do you attend music-related events?”*
* This question assessed how likely participants are to engage with event-related content and features of the application.

*“What challenges have you faced when searching for music-related events in your local area?”*
* Participants’ responses highlighted existing frustrations in event discovery, providing insight for the team to refine features and address these issues within SoundCircle.

*“If a platform helped you discover events and connect with others based on shared music interests, what would make it stand out for you?”*
* This open-ended question encouraged participants to share specific ideas for making SoundCircle a unique and valuable utility.

### Task-Based Testing
Participants completed six structured tasks to evaluate various aspects of the prototype. Each task simulated a realistic scenario and was designed to test specific features and their usability.

**Task 1: Finding and following an artist**
* This task assessed how easily participants could use the search and navigation features to locate and follow an artist and provided insight into the system’s learnability and efficiency.

**Task 2: Locating an event**
* The purpose of this task was to evaluate the prototype’s event discovery system, focusing on how well participants could find relevant information.

**Task 3: Responding to a direct message
* This task tested the communication features, assessing how intuitive and straightforward it was for participants to interact with direct messages.

**Task 4: Joining a local group**
* By having participants find and join a group, this task evaluated the accessibility of community-building features within the application.

**Task 5: Commenting on a post**
* This task focused on how participants engaged with public content, providing feedback on interaction design and user satisfaction.

**Task 6: Creating and sharing a review for an album**
* This task examined the content creation process, assessing how smoothly participants could share their opinions with others.

After completing each task, participants were asked to rate its difficulty on a scale from 1 to 5 and explain their rating. This approach combined both quantitative and qualitative feedback, allowing the team to pinpoint problem areas for improvement.

### Debrief
The study concluded with a debrief session to gather participants’ overall impressions of the prototype. Open-ended questions encouraged participants to reflect on their experiences and provide actionable feedback for the UX team.

*“How would you describe your overall experience using this prototype?”*
* This question aimed to evaluate general usability and participant satisfaction, offering high-level insights into the platform’s effectiveness.

*“What were your initial thoughts about the website’s design and layout?”*
* Participants’ responses to this question provided feedback on the visual design and aesthetic impact on first impressions.

*“Was the purpose of this website clear to you? Why or why not?”*
* By assessing clarity, this question helped identify areas where the purpose or functionality of the application could be communicated more effectively.

*“Were there any tasks that you found particularly difficult or confusing to accomplish? Why?”*
* This question allowed participants to highlight specific usability issues and guide future targeted design improvements.

*“What did you like most about the website?”*
* Positive feedback from this question helped identify strengths to build upon in future iterations.

*“What would you change or improve to make it better?”*
* Constructive feedback from participants provided direct suggestions for enhancing the user experience.

*“How likely are you to use a platform like this in the future? Why?”*
* This question assessed participants’ overall interest and likelihood of adopting SoundCircle in order to reveal its potential long-term appeal.

### Overall Approach
The study focused on following a formative evaluation approach, primarily identifying and addressing usability issues in the prototype’s early development stage. Using the think-aloud protocol, participants verbalized their thoughts while interacting with the prototype. This method allowed the team to capture immediate insights into participants' cognitive process, helping uncover challenges and opportunities for future refinement.

## Findings

The usability test was conducted with 6 participants to evaluate the ease of use and user experience of our SoundCircle prototype. The data collection includes both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics.

**Quantitative Data**
* Task Completion Rate: 93% of participants successfully completed the primary task (navigating home/user page, following a user, adding a group, looking up people/artists) without assistance.
* Error rate: An average of 30% of participants agree that the "nearby" option on the homepage was too small to see. In addition, more than 50% of participants had trouble looking for a way to make an album review that was located in the user's "Review" page.

**Qualitative Data**
* Even though there are difficulties in completing some of the tasks, most participants' feedback on the prototype is extremely positive. They appreciated the intuitive design of the homepage and the feature to connect with others based on music taste.
* In addition, although most of the feedback was positive and the participants successfully completed most of the given tasks. There are some drawbacks that the team had to acknowledge in order to make improvements: There was too much information on the screen, the sidebar looked like an advertisement, and the product looked too close to Facebook.

## Conclusions
From the user testing of the SoundCircle prototype, we observed that most users interacted well and completed tasks with varying degrees of success. In terms of usability, some users found the interface to be intuitive, fresh, well-designed, and enjoyable. However, others felt that certain sections were redundant, the prototype had issues, and important areas were overlooked due to clutter.

The implementation of the prototype faced limitations due to time constraints and software usability issues. Consequently, many aspects of the variability and openness of our design were not fully realized. Users tended to disregard the sidebar on the main page because they saw it as not useful, a distraction, or even as advertisements, making them less likely to use it. It would be important to either simplify its design, have it pop up only when the user wants it to, or remove it and place its features elsewhere. We would keep the similar design of the pages but add more clarifications as well as more buttons for important and commonly used tasks.

Based on user experiences, we found that our pages needed to be more concise and less cluttered, with more important features being easier to see. Additionally, we should focus on creating a unique identity for SoundCircle rather than mirroring popular social media platforms. While we chose similar designs to help users feel at ease and familiar with other products, we should aim to make SoundCircle stand out as a separate entity. It's also important to consider the different ways and paths participants completed tasks that we hadn't considered initially. Understanding these user behaviors is valuable for future designs.

We believe that we have a pretty good start but still have a lot to improve when it comes to usability. Testers provided valuable feedback, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. The insights gathered will guide the next steps in refining and enhancing the SoundCircle application.

## Caveats
One significant issue highlighted by our users was the inconsistencies and buggy behavior of our prototyping software, which was largely out of our control. Users also expressed their displeasure about the limited search capabilities within our prototype. This limitation was partly a design flaw and partly a consequence of time constraints and the extensive iterations required to implement comprehensive search functionality.

Another limitation was the decreased size of our testing pool, which made it difficult to obtain a proper gauge of a sufficiently diverse and representative sample. The participants were somewhat biased towards the tasks at hand, as they were learning alongside us, making them less susceptible to typical user challenges. The lack of randomness and diversity in our user pool prevented us from capturing the genuine fresh perspectives that a random user could provide.

Our product should have also been tested across varying levels of technological literacy and usability, as it is unfair to group only computer degree-based users. Additionally, we aimed to test people with higher interests in music, concerts, and social connections through music. However, testing a more general population also provided useful insights.
