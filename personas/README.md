Even though she loves high energy situations, she is shy and has had no luck making friends with similar musical tastes. She doesn't have a car and instead uses public travel to get places making it harder to get around to meet new people. 
She also wants to start things slow when meeting new people and rather not give out her phone number and social media profiles.

She wants to have the most fun she can have before settling into her career in the next year or so and make some friends along the way.

Around closing time at the record store, Tom was approached by his assistant-manager Sarah. Sarah asks Tom if he knows of any local Jazz groups that might be around. Tom isn’t very knowledgeable about the local Jazz scene, but promises to find a group to host at the record store soon.
